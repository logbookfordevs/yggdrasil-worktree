**Yggdrasil Worktree** (invoked as `yggtree`) is an interactive CLI designed to turn Git worktrees into a first‑class workflow.

Like the mythical world tree connecting realms, Yggdrasil lets you grow isolated, parallel environments where ideas can evolve independently without colliding.

For guided workflows, command examples, and safety notes, read the full docs:
**[yggtree.logbookfordevs.com/docs](https://yggtree.logbookfordevs.com/docs)**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g yggtree
```

Or try it without installing:

```bash
npx yggtree
```

### Agent Skills

An agent skill is now available for your favorite agents.

`yggtree` ships one consolidated skill that helps agents choose the right
worktree workflow first, then load the smallest reference they need:

* **Create a task worktree**: start a brand-new branch-backed task in parallel.
* **Branch off without stashing**: jump into another branch without disturbing
  the work already in progress.
* **Bootstrap and use a realm**: prepare a worktree, open it in your IDE, or
  run commands inside it.
* **Run sandbox experiments**: try alternative approaches locally and
  apply/unapply the winner safely.

This skill is especially useful with agents like **Claude Code**,
**Codex**, **Cursor**, **Gemini CLI**, and other tools that support the open
Skills ecosystem.

Install it with the Skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add logbookfordevs/yggdrasil-worktree
```

Install it globally for your user:

```bash
npx skills add logbookfordevs/yggdrasil-worktree --global
```

Install only the consolidated `yggtree` skill:

```bash
npx skills add logbookfordevs/yggdrasil-worktree --skill yggtree
```

If your agent supports targeted installs, you can also point the install to a
specific agent runtime, for example:

```bash
npx skills add logbookfordevs/yggdrasil-worktree --agent codex
```

### Basic Usage

Run with no arguments to open the interactive menu:

```bash
yggtree
```

Or use commands directly:

```bash
yggtree create
yggtree list
yggtree wc --ref my-feature
yggtree -v
```

The older `yggtree wt ...` form still works for compatibility, but direct commands are the preferred shape.

## 🧠 Mental Model

Yggdrasil is built around a few core ideas:

* **Branches are ideas**
* **Worktrees are realities**
* **Each task deserves its own realm**

Instead of constantly switching branches in one working directory, Yggdrasil creates **isolated worktrees**, each mapped to a branch, living outside your main repo.

All managed worktrees live under:

```
~/.yggtree/<repo-name>/<worktree-slug>
```

This keeps your main repository clean while enabling true parallelism.
You can change the global managed worktree location with `yggtree config`.

---

## 🤔 Why Yggdrasil Worktree?

Git worktrees are powerful, but once you start doing **parallel work**, they become tedious to manage manually.

Modern development looks like this:

* Fixing a bug
* Reviewing a PR
* Prototyping a feature
* Letting AI agents explore refactors
* Running tests in isolation

All at the same time.

Yggdrasil exists to solve three problems together:

1. Parallel work without context collision
2. Fast, repeatable environment setup
3. Agent‑friendly isolation for AI workflows

Each worktree becomes its own **small realm**, safe to explore and easy to discard.

---

## ✨ Key Features

🌳 **First-class worktree workflow**
Create, manage, and navigate Git worktrees as a primary workflow, not an afterthought.

🧠 **Parallel development by default**
Work on multiple branches at the same time, each in its own isolated environment.

🧪 **Sandbox worktrees for experimentation**
Prototyping something risky? Create a sandbox, try different strategies, and apply the winner back to your origin branch.

🤝 **Handoff current work**
Started in your main checkout? Carry staged, unstaged, and untracked work into a named sandbox worktree and continue there.

🤖 **AI-friendly isolation**
One worktree per agent, per experiment, per idea. No shared state, no collisions.

⚡ **Automatic bootstrapping**
Run installs, submodules, and setup scripts automatically for each worktree.

🚪 **Enter, exec, and exit with ease**
Enter worktrees, execute commands, or run tasks without changing directories.

📍 **Predictable structure**
Managed worktrees default to `~/.yggtree`, with an optional global path setting for agent-native layouts.

🧭 **Interactive or scriptable**
Use the interactive UI or drive everything through commands and flags.

---

## 🧠 Parallel Development, Done Right

```bash
yggtree create feat/city-selection
yggtree create fix/validation
yggtree create chore/cleanup-api
```

Each command creates:

* A clean folder
* A dedicated branch
* A bootstrapped environment

No stash juggling.
No branch confusion.
No shared state accidents.

---

## 🤖 Built for AI‑Assisted Workflows

Yggdrasil shines when paired with AI agents.

Instead of running agents against the same directory, you can assign **one worktree per agent**.

```bash
yggtree create feat/ai-refactor-a --exec "cursor ."
yggtree create feat/ai-refactor-b --exec "codex"
```

Each agent operates in its own realm:

* Model A refactors architecture
* Model B focuses on tests
* Model C explores performance

All in parallel. All reviewable. All isolated.

---

## 🧪 Sandbox Worktrees

Sometimes you don't want to "commit to a branch" yet. You just want to try something out—or perhaps try three different ways of solving the same problem.

**Sandboxes** are temporary, local-only worktrees designed for this:

1.  **Create**: `yggtree create-sandbox` (creates something like `sandbox-a3f2_feature-branch`).
2.  **Experiment**: Change files, run tests, try that risky refactor.
3.  **Apply**: `yggtree apply` to "push" those file changes back to your origin directory.
4.  **Unapply**: Don't like it? `yggtree unapply` restores your origin to exactly how it was before.

Sandboxes are **not pushed to remote**. Omit the name for a generated temporary sandbox, or provide one when the work needs to be easy to find later.

Use `handoff` when you started in the origin checkout and want to continue that dirty work in a sandbox:

```bash
yggtree handoff --name auth-refactor
```

---

## ⚡ Bootstrapping & Configuration

Yggdrasil automatically prepares each worktree.

Resolution order:

1. `.yggtree/worktree-setup.json` in the repo root
2. `yggtree-worktree.json` in the repo root (legacy fallback)
3. `.cursor/worktrees.json` in the repo root (legacy fallback)
4. `.yggtree/worktree-setup.json` inside the worktree (per-worktree fallback)
5. `yggtree-worktree.json` inside the worktree (legacy fallback)
6. `.cursor/worktrees.json` inside the worktree (legacy fallback)
7. Fallback: `npm install` + submodules

### Example configuration

```json
{
  "setup-worktree": [
    "npm install",
    "git submodule sync --recursive",
    "git submodule update --init --recursive",
    "echo \"🌳 Realm ready\""
  ]
}
```

---

## 🗂️ Global Worktree Paths

By default, managed worktrees use the Yggtree layout:

```bash
~/.yggtree/<repo-name>/<worktree-slug>
```

Show the active global setting:

```bash
yggtree config get
```

Use the Codex-style layout when you want Yggtree-created worktrees to live under Codex's worktree root:

```bash
yggtree config use codex
```

That preset creates new managed worktrees like:

```bash
~/.codex/worktrees/<worktree-slug>/<repo-name>
```

Set a custom managed root while keeping the Yggtree layout:

```bash
yggtree config set-worktrees-root ~/Worktrees
```

Return to defaults:

```bash
yggtree config reset
```

Claude and Cursor do not currently have a confirmed native worktree directory pattern in Yggtree. Until that is explicit, use `set-worktrees-root` with the directory you want rather than relying on an unverified preset.

## 🛠️ Command Reference

### `yggtree`

Open the interactive menu.

---

### `yggtree create [branch]`

Create a worktree from a branch.

Options:

* `-b, --branch <name>`
* `--base <ref>`
* `--source local|remote`
* `--no-bootstrap`
* `--open / --no-open`
* `--enter / --no-enter`
* `--exec "<command>"`

Interactive flow:

* Instead of asking for a free-form `exec` command, yggtree now asks if you want to open an editor after creation.
* After creation, yggtree enters the new worktree shell unless you pass `--no-enter`.
* `--exec` remains available as an advanced explicit override.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```bash
yggtree create feat/new-ui --base main --exec "cursor ."
```

</details>

---

### `yggtree worktree-checkout [name] [ref]`

Create a checkout-style worktree from an existing branch.

Behavior:

* Prompts a searchable branch picker (type to filter in real time).
* Attaches the new worktree directly to the selected branch (checkout-style).
* If a branch exists both locally and on `origin`, the picker shows both `branch` (local) and `origin/branch` (remote tip, detached) as explicit choices.
* If you select a remote-only branch (`origin/*`), yggtree creates the local branch in the new worktree automatically.
* If that branch already has an active worktree, yggtree falls back to using that worktree instead of creating a duplicate.
* By default, yggtree ends the flow inside the worktree shell.
* `yggtree wc` is a short alias for the same flow.

Options:

* `-n, --name <slug>`
* `-r, --ref <ref>`: skip picker and use a specific branch (`feature/x` or `origin/feature/x`)
* `--no-bootstrap`
* `--open / --no-open`: choose whether to open editors or run a startup command before the worktree shell starts
* `--tool <command>`: open a specific editor, app, or terminal target and skip the open prompt (`cursor`, `code`, `codex-app`, `cmux`, `tmux`)
* `--no-enter`: finish after create/open and return to the caller
* `--exec "<command>"`

Interactive flow:

* Yggtree asks what to open before starting the worktree shell.
* Shell-entry flows use a single action picker, so pressing Enter on Cmux or Tmux chooses that terminal target directly.
* Plain `yggtree open` flows use the same single action picker and return after opening the selected target.
* Use `--tool` to skip the open prompt and launch one editor/app or terminal target directly.
* Cmux, Tmux, and `Other command...` are mutually exclusive because the open picker accepts one action.
* `Other command...` runs a command in the Yggtree shell first, then leaves you there.
* Use `--no-enter` when you only want the worktree created/opened and the command to return.
* `--exec` remains available as an advanced explicit override.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```bash
yggtree worktree-checkout -n hotfix-auth -r main --no-open
yggtree wc hotfix-auth main --open
yggtree wc hotfix-auth main --tool codex-app
yggtree wc hotfix-auth main --open --no-enter
```

</details>

---

### `yggtree create-sandbox`

Create a temporary sandbox from your current local branch.

Options:

*   `-n, --name <name>`: Optional sandbox name (auto-generated if omitted).
*   `--carry / --no-carry`: Bring uncommitted changes (staged/unstaged/untracked) with you.
*   `--no-bootstrap`
*   `--open / --no-open`
*   `--exec "<command>"`

Interactive flow:

* Prompts for an optional sandbox name (leave empty to auto-generate one from current branch).
* Instead of asking for a free-form `exec` command, yggtree now asks if you want to open an editor after creation.
* `--exec` remains available as an advanced explicit override.

---

### `yggtree handoff`

Carry uncommitted work from the current checkout into a sandbox worktree.

Options:

*   `-n, --name <name>`: Optional handoff name (prompted when omitted).
*   `--no-bootstrap`
*   `--open / --no-open`
*   `--exec "<command>"`

This is the continuation-focused version of `create-sandbox --carry`: it keeps sandbox metadata and apply/unapply behavior, but defaults to carrying staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

---

### `yggtree apply`

Apply changes from the current sandbox back to the origin repository. 
*   **Backs up** origin files before overwriting.
*   **Offers to delete** the sandbox after applying.

---

### `yggtree unapply`

Undo a previous `apply` operation.
*   Restores origin files from the sandbox's backup.
*   *Note: Only works if the sandbox worktree still exists.*

---

### `yggtree create-multi`

Create multiple worktrees at once.

Options:

* `--base <ref>`
* `--source local|remote`
* `--no-bootstrap`

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```bash
yggtree create-multi --base main
```

</details>

---

### `yggtree list`

List all repo-linked worktrees with state.

Columns:

* TYPE (`MAIN`, `MANAGED`, `LINKED`, `SANDBOX`)
* STATE (clean / dirty)
* LAST ACTIVE
* PR (optional — requires [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/))
* BRANCH

Notes:

* Entries are grouped by `TYPE`.
* `SANDBOX` and `MANAGED` are worktrees inside the configured managed worktree root.
* External worktrees are labeled `LINKED`.
* Use `--open` to switch this flow into "pick and open in tool" mode.
* The **PR** column shows the pull request status for each branch (e.g. `OPEN`, `IN REVIEW`, `APPROVED`, `MERGED`, `DRAFT`, `CHANGES`). It only appears when `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated — otherwise it's silently omitted.

---

### `yggtree open [worktree]`

Open a worktree in an editor, supported desktop app, or terminal target.

Behavior:

* If `[worktree]` is omitted, you can pick from the worktree list with type-to-filter search.
* Detects available editor commands in your `PATH` (for example: `cursor`, `code`, `zed`, `webstorm`).
* Detects Codex App on macOS and launches it with `open -b com.openai.codex`.
* Detects Cmux and Tmux when their CLI commands are available.
* Lets you choose one editor, app, or terminal target interactively, or pass `--tool`.
* Keeps Cmux, Tmux, and `Other command...` mutually exclusive by using a single action picker.
* By default, `open` launches the selected target and returns, except foreground terminal targets such as Tmux.
* Use `wc --open` when you want to open a worktree and continue in its shell.

Options:

* `--tool <command>` (for example: `cursor`, `code`, `codex`, `codex-app`, `cmux`, or `tmux`)

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>

```bash
yggtree open
yggtree open feat/new-ui --tool cursor
yggtree open feat/new-ui --tool codex-app
yggtree open feat/new-ui --tool tmux
yggtree list --open
```

</details>

---

### `yggtree exec [worktree] -- <command>`

Run a command inside a worktree without changing your current terminal.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```bash
yggtree exec feat/new-ui -- npm test
```

</details>

---

### `yggtree path [worktree]`

Print a `cd` command for a worktree.

Useful for scripting and shell aliases.

---

### `yggtree bootstrap`

Re‑run bootstrap commands for a worktree.

---

### `yggtree delete`

Interactively delete worktrees.

Behavior:

* Default flow targets managed worktrees.
* In interactive mode, yggtree asks whether to include external linked worktrees.
* In direct CLI usage, `--all` includes external linked worktrees (main/current are still excluded for safety).
* The delete selector shows 6 items per page.

Optional:

* `--all` includes linked worktrees outside the configured managed root (main/current worktree is excluded for safety)

---

### `yggtree prune`

Clean up stale git worktree metadata.

---

## 🌱 When Should You Use Yggdrasil?

Yggdrasil is ideal when:

* You work on multiple tasks in parallel
* You use AI agents for exploration
* You want isolation without duplication
* You value scripted, repeatable setups
* `git checkout` no longer scales

---

## 📝 Practical Examples

<details>
<summary>Create a worktree with the guided post-create flow</summary>

**Command:**

```
yggtree create feat/login-flow
```

**What happens:**

* Creates a new branch if it doesn’t exist (without inheriting base tracking), then publishes it to `origin` when possible
* Creates a dedicated worktree
* Runs bootstrap if enabled
* Lets you choose whether to open an editor after creation


</details>
---

<details>
<summary>Create a worktree without bootstrap, opening a tool, or entering</summary>

**Command:**

```
yggtree create feat/cleanup-api --no-bootstrap --no-open --no-enter
```

**When to use:**

* You just want the folder ready
* You’ll open it or move into its shell later if needed
* You don’t want installs running automatically

</details>
---

<details>
<summary>Create a worktree and open it in your IDE</summary>

**Command:**

```
yggtree create feat/ui-refactor --exec "cursor ."
```

Works with:

* `cursor .`
* `code .`
* Any custom command available in your shell

</details>
---

<details>
<summary>Execute a command inside an existing worktree (no shell)</summary>

**Command:**

```
yggtree exec test -- npm test
```

**What this does:**

* Runs the command inside the selected worktree
* Keeps your current terminal where it is
* Ideal for CI-like checks, scripts, or quick validations

</details>
---

<details>
<summary>Checkout a branch and run a startup command</summary>

**Command:**

```
yggtree wc --ref test --open
```

**What happens:**

* Checks out or reuses the branch worktree
* Lets you choose an editor, supported app, or `Other command...`
* Starts a worktree shell unless you pass `--no-enter`
* Type `exit` to return to your original directory

</details>
---

<details>
<summary>Get the path to a worktree</summary>

**Command:**

```
yggtree path test
```

**Output:**

```
cd ~/.yggtree/your-repo-name/test
```

Useful when you want to manually navigate or copy the path into scripts.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>Try a risky refactor in a Sandbox</summary>

**Command:**

```bash
yggtree create-sandbox --carry
```

**Scenario:**

1.  You have 5 files changed in your main repo but aren't sure about the direction.
2.  Run `handoff --name risky-refactor` to carry those changes into an isolated `sandbox-risky-refactor` folder.
3.  Experiment freely.
4.  If it works: `yggtree apply`.
5.  If it fails: Just delete the sandbox or `unapply`.
